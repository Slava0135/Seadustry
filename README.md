# Seadustry 2.0 - mindustry v8 support
Skyblock but in sea for Mindustry.

## Description
Intended to be played with my other mod ([reVision](https://github.com/Slava0135/reVision)) and a bundled map called Seadustry.
You start on a sand island, you have got some resources. You can get more scrap by killing units or by using sieve. 
Expand your land. Improvise and adapt.

__NOTE: There is no way to return liquid tiles back!__

## Feedback

Original map was not heavily playtested and may be unbalanced in some ways.

Feel free to submit new maps for the mod!
